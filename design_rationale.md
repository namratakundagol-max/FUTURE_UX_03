**FUTURE_UX_03 – CRM Dashboard Design Rationale**

##1. Problem

Small home cleaning businesses find it difficult to:
Track leads
Manage clients
Follow up properly
Track revenue
Maintain internal notes
They often use Excel or WhatsApp, which is not structured.
So I designed a CRM dashboard for a Home Cleaning business called CleanPro.

##2. Dashboard Overview

The dashboard includes:
KPI cards (Total Leads, Revenue, etc.)
Lead Pipeline
Client List
Client Profile
This helps business owners quickly understand performance.

##3. Lead Pipeline

I used 4 stages:
New Lead
Contacted
Proposal Sent
Closed
This helps track where each client is in the sales process.
Color-coded badges make it easy to understand status quickly.

##4. Client List Page

This page shows structured table data:
Client Name
Service
Status
Last Contact
Revenue
This helps in managing all clients in one place.

##5. Client Profile Page
   
This page shows:
Client details
Booking history
Activity timeline
Internal notes
This gives full information about one client in detail.

##6. UX Decisions

Used soft colors for modern SaaS look
Used badges for status clarity
Used clean spacing for readability
Kept layout simple and professional

##8. Conclusion
   
This CRM dashboard design helps home cleaning businesses:
Track leads
Manage clients
Monitor revenue
Improve follow-ups
The design follows real-world CRM workflow logic and modern dashboard UI principles.
